# Aquarium
The task is to implement the following functionality in JavaScript to provide behavior and interactivity for
the various objects in the aquarium. All implementation must be done using jQuery selectors and functions.
## Object: One orange fish
Behavior: Whenever you click somewhere in the aquarium the orange fish should move to that location in a
gradual motion. In addition, when you double click on the orange fish, it should increase its size for a few
seconds before returning to normal.
## Object: One blue fish
Behavior: Whenever you try to move the mouse cursor over the blue fish, it will swiftly move to a random
location inside the view of the aquarium.
## Object: Both fish
Behavior: When a fish is not otherwise being interacted with, it will slowly move around in random
directions on its own. It will never move outside of the aquarium view though.
## Object: Three bubbles
Behavior: Each bubble moves into the view of the aquarium from the bottom of the screen and exists in the
top. When a bubble moves out of view in the top it will enter anew in the bottom. Where it will enter will
be random. In addition, when you click on a bubble, it will disappear in a fading manner, but will
immediately after reappear at a random entry point in the bottom of the screen.
